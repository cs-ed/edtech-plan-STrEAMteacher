Students enrolled in the class will be taking the AP Computer Science Principles exam at the end of the year for possible college credit.


### Situation

**Academy of Careers and Exploration**

The Academy of Careers and Exploration (ACE), established in 2008, is a public charter school and serves as the only high school in the Helendale Elementary School District. Helendale is a fringe town located in the Victor Valley of the Mojave Desert in San Bernardino county. As a District, Helendale Elementary serves a population of 5,062 students.  With a total population of about 439, ACE primarily enrolls students from the surrounding community of Silver Lakes in Helendale, along with students from neighboring towns of Adelanto, Victorville, and Barstow.  

**School Demographic by Ethnicity:**
- Hispanic or Latino: 48.2%
- White: 38.8%
- African American: 10.4%
- Asian: 0.6%
- Filipino: 0.6%
- Pacific Islander: 0.6%
- Two or more races: 0.5%
- American Indian or Alaska Native: 0.3%

Approximately 46% of the student population are eligible for free/reduced lunch. Around 4.9% of the population are English learners and 13% are designated as Special Education students. ACE is a small school. Typically, there are only two teachers for each core subject, one teacher teaches the 9th and 10th grade, while the other teaches the 11th and 12th grades. It is normal for teachers to have 3-5 subject preps. For electives, the school has a part-time band/music teacher, an art teacher, and a CTE teacher. The other core-subject teachers typically add on an elective course or two to their course schedule. 

Through the principal’s initiative, by the 2015-16 school year,  every classroom at ACE had Chromebook carts, providing each student with a Chromebook. That year, the District invested in Google’s G Suite for Education.  Teachers were encouraged to set up Google classrooms for their classes for students to access curriculum resources and work, minimizing the need for copying copious amounts of paper documents. Therefore, when the COVID-19 pandemic hit and we were forced to transition to Distance Learning in the Spring of 2020, it was a relatively less arduous process because the students were already used to accessing lesson and assignment information through Google classroom and using Gmail as a primary mode of communication with teachers. Zoom was used as the primary video conferencing platform; although in the Spring of 2020, class attendance through Zoom was optional. Google classroom was the primary mode of communication and platform for delivering pre-taped video lessons and other class resources. 

In order to prepare for the 2020-21 school year, the District purchased additional technology equipment in order to cater to the hybrid synchronous and asynchronous learning model that was implemented. Computer laptops were purchased for teachers to use and additional Chromebooks were purchased so that each student had one to use at home. Hot spots were also purchased and provided to families with limited Internet access. When the schools were cleared to open in late Spring of 2021, the District purchased even more technology equipment to support concurrent teaching of students in the classroom as well as students via Zoom. At the time, on average, only 10% of the class attended school in person, while the rest attended synchronously via zoom. 

According to the Academy of Careers and Exploration mission statement, “The Academy of Careers and Exploration exists to prepare every student to learn and work in the 21st century.” Although there are many facets of the school that address this, the school does not currently offer any classes in computer science. Limited exposure to computer programming is possible through a couple elective courses, Introduction to Robotics and STEAM Art. The addition of AP Computer Science Principles course is an optimal opportunity to “prepare every student to learn and work in the 21st century.”

### Application

This will be the first ever computer class offered at ACE. In an effort to facilitate the implementation of the AP Computer Science Principles course, it will be proposed that we adopt the curriculum offered through CodeHS. CodeHs is endorsed and recognized by the College Board for AP computer science courses. Its curriculum is aligned to support the learning standards and frameworks set by the College Board Advanced Placement. This will greatly facilitate the auditing process needed to implement the class. Furthermore, this course has been UC A-G approved. 

As described by the CodeHS curriculum, the AP Computer Science Principles course is delivered through a blended classroom approach, with web-based and physical activities. The class is divided into eighteen units. Students will access the online curriculum using the laptops from the classroom set; or their personal computers at home. Students who do not have access to computers at home will have the option to check out computers from the office. Students will use the CodeHS IDE to write and run code. Other activities include designing websites and other digital artifacts. Through this process students will have opportunities to engage and collaborate to complete the assigned projects. 

Each unit will include video lessons, short quizzes to test understanding, sample programs to explore and modify, programming assignments. Units will also offer opportunities for collaborative projects to engage students in pair-programming. End of unit assessments will be used to gauge student learning. Towards the last quarter of the course, students will have  a creative project that will center on creating programming solutions to a real-world situation/problem.

**Implementation of Lessons and Activities**

A typical unit will start with a pre-assessment activity to gauge students’ background knowledge as well as their interests. This will serve to determine how much instruction may be needed to fill in any gaps, and when possible, how to best design programming activities to cater to the students’ interests. Since each lesson is pre-equipped to begin with video lessons, a flipped classroom approach will be implemented where these will be assigned as homework. The next day, students will be posed questions to determine their understanding of the video lessons. Google classroom easily allows the formation of a question form that students can answer. Results of multiple choice questions are easily translated into pie charts to facilitate analysis of student responses. Peer-instruction will be a major strategy used to increase student engagement and promote active learning. The initial results of the polling questions can be presented to the class. If the results show a lack of understanding, students will form small discussion groups (2-3 students) to re-evaluate the questions. A second question poll given to the individual groups will be taken. Analysis of the poll results will show whether or not understanding was achieved or not. If necessary, at this point, directed instruction that clarifies misunderstandings, or emphasizes important points will be provided. The lessons typically proceed with smaller programming tasks. Students will work in their small groups for an “unplugged” activity as they discuss their strategy in accomplishing the programming tasks. If needed, there are additional scaffolding activities available to the students who need additional help. The sample program exercises allow students to explore how the code works, providing more background and practice for the small programming assignments. As an activity output, the groups will come up with a flow-chart or a picture model of how the program will work. From these pictorial representations, the group will write pseudo-code for the programming assignment. Based on their group activity and discussions, students will then complete writing these small programming assignments individually.

Units typically culminate with a major programming challenge assignment that is geared toward real-life applications. Students will work in pairs; pairs can be determined based on common interests revealed from the pre-assessment activity conducted at the start of the unit. The pairs will start with “unplugged” activities where they will discuss the parameters of the project and brainstorm a plan. They will create a flow chart of their strategy and write the pseudo code to represent their program. Before proceeding to writing the actual code, they will meet with the teacher to discuss their flowchart and pseudo code. 

Pair-programming will be the strategy implemented to write the actual code for the challenge project. Students in the paired group will decide if they would prefer to be the “driver” or the “navigator”. As far as technology is concerned, students will be sharing one laptop during the activity, giving full keyboard and mouse control to the “driver”. Eventually it would be nice to set up programming stations where the laptop can be hooked up to an external monitor that the “navigator” can look at, allowing for more spatial freedom between the two students. This may make it easier for the “navigator” to follow and read the code that is being typed by the “driver”. The teacher will have to reach out to the Director of Technology and Director of Finance in the District for funds or the availability of extra monitors to be used in the computer science class. The students’ work, such as the code itself, can be easily monitored through the GoGuardian program that teachers have running on their computers to visually access what the groups are actually doing during class. 

There are pre-made assessments at the end of each unit. Furthermore there are performance tasks that help students prepare for the AP test. In the beginning, performance tasks can be assigned to pairs of students working together. As students learn and gain more experience, performance tasks will be assigned individually so students gain the confidence to be successful on the AP test at the end of the year.



### Impacts

Helendale School District’s Learning Continuity and Attendance Plan (LCAP) describes how the District concentrated and dedicated its efforts to support the needs of students through Distance Learning by making sure every student had access to technology to support their education. During the 2020-21 school year, the District made sure to have in place the proper technology to successfully implement Distance Learning synchronously or asynchronously. This school year, the additional technology purchased continues to support this need. The continuing pandemic has led to unprecedented absenteeism due to either infection or mandatory quarantine, therefore, concurrent instruction to students in-person, as well as those via Zoom, is necessary. Much to the chagrin of the teachers regarding this challenging feat, all classrooms are set up such that we are able to teach to these two populations of students. 

As much as our school is called the Academy of Careers and Exploration, we have yet to offer classes in computer science.  Having a class such as AP Computer Science Principles is a huge opportunity for the students in our school. There is a growing interest in computer programming at our school. The enrollment in the Introduction to Robotics course is increasing and holding steady. When the course was introduced to the school in 2017, at the start of the year 21 students were placed in the class but only 9 remained for the year. In the succeeding year, the number of enrolled students has increased, including increased enrollment of female students in the class. Informal surveys show that students enjoyed learning how to code for the Arduino microcontroller. In the STEAM class, one of the units students enjoyed the most was the coding unit where students had the opportunity to design their own app. Offering a computer science class will capitalize on this increasing interest and demand. Being a rural school in a fringe community, opening students’ awareness to the field of computer science promises to reap many benefits and contribute to our students’ future success.

The class will be open to any student interested in taking the class, as long as the Algebra 1 math, or equivalent, prerequisite is fulfilled. Classes at our school rarely have over 25 students to allow an optimal teacher-student ratio. If this number is maintained, then there will be enough laptops available for a 1:1 ratio. In the event that there are Special Education students enrolled in the class, the teacher typically works closely with the Special Education specialist to enhance the IEP and to provide the necessary accommodations for the student in the computer science class. This will also apply to special needs students where teachers work closely with the school counselors to optimize their 504 plans. One challenge, however, regarding special needs students is the lack of assistive technology if needed. For example, at present we lack the resources we would need to support visually-impaired students in a computer science classroom. However, should the need arise, again, due to our small-school district situation, the teacher can easily contact the Superintendent and District Finance Officer for additional support and resources. Our school also has an EL specialist who teachers can work with to provide additional support for EL students. Our small school environment may have limited resources and staff, but there is a strong collaborative culture on our campus. Like any other class on campus, this strong collaborative culture facilitates communication between teachers and the specialists, optimizing student, as well as the much needed teacher support.
