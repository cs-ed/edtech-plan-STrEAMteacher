Students enrolled in the class will be taking the AP Computer Science Principles exam at the end of the year for possible college credit.


### Situation

**Academy of Careers and Exploration**

The Academy of Careers and Exploration (ACE), established in 2008, is a public charter school and serves as the only high school in the Helendale Elementary School District. Helendale is a fringe town located in the Victor Valley of the Mojave Desert in San Bernardino county. As a District, Helendale Elementary serves a population of 5,062 students.  With a total population of about 439, ACE primarily enrolls students from the surrounding community of Silver Lakes in Helendale, along with students from neighboring towns of Adelanto, Victorville, and Barstow.  

**School Demographic by Ethnicity:**
- Hispanic or Latino: 48.2%
- White: 38.8%
- African American: 10.4%
- Asian: 0.6%
- Filipino: 0.6%
- Pacific Islander: 0.6%
- Two or more races: 0.5%
- American Indian or Alaska Native: 0.3%

Approximately 46% of the student population are eligible for free/reduced lunch. Around 4.9% of the population are English learners and 13% are designated as Special Education students. ACE is a small school. Typically, there are only two teachers for each core subject, one teacher teaches the 9th and 10th grade, while the other teaches the 11th and 12th grades. It is normal for teachers to have 3-5 subject preps. For electives, the school has a part-time band/music teacher, an art teacher, and a CTE teacher. The other core-subject teachers typically add on an elective course or two to their course schedule. 

Through the principal’s initiative, by the 2015-16 school year,  every classroom at ACE had Chromebook carts, providing each student with a Chromebook. That year, the District invested in Google’s G Suite for Education.  Teachers were encouraged to set up Google classrooms for their classes for students to access curriculum resources and work, minimizing the need for copying copious amounts of paper documents. Therefore, when the COVID-19 pandemic hit and we were forced to transition to Distance Learning in the Spring of 2020, it was a relatively less arduous process because the students were already used to accessing lesson and assignment information through Google classroom and using Gmail as a primary mode of communication with teachers. Zoom was used as the primary video conferencing platform; although in the Spring of 2020, class attendance through Zoom was optional. Google classroom was the primary mode of communication and platform for delivering pre-taped video lessons and other class resources. 

In order to prepare for the 2020-21 school year, the District purchased additional technology equipment in order to cater to the hybrid synchronous and asynchronous learning model that was implemented. Computer laptops were purchased for teachers to use and additional Chromebooks were purchased so that each student had one to use at home. Hot spots were also purchased and provided to families with limited Internet access. When the schools were cleared to open in late Spring of 2021, the District purchased even more technology equipment to support concurrent teaching of students in the classroom as well as students via Zoom. At the time, on average, only 10% of the class attended school in person, while the rest attended synchronously via zoom. 

According to the Academy of Careers and Exploration mission statement, “The Academy of Careers and Exploration exists to prepare every student to learn and work in the 21st century.” Although there are many facets of the school that address this, the school does not currently offer any classes in computer science. Limited exposure to computer programming is possible through a couple elective courses, Introduction to Robotics and STEAM Art. The addition of AP Computer Science Principles course is an optimal opportunity to “prepare every student to learn and work in the 21st century.”

### Application

This will be the first ever computer class offered at ACE. In an effort to facilitate the implementation of the AP Computer Science Principles course, it will be proposed that we adopt the curriculum offered through CodeHS. CodeHs is endorsed and recognized by the College Board for AP computer science courses. Its curriculum is aligned to support the learning standards and frameworks set by the College Board Advanced Placement. This will greatly facilitate the auditing process needed to implement the class. Furthermore, this course has been UC A-G approved. 

As described by the CodeHS curriculum, the AP Computer Science Principles course is delivered through a blended classroom approach, with web-based and physical activities. The class is divided into eighteen units. Students will access the online curriculum using the laptops from the classroom set; or their personal computers at home. Students who do not have access to computers at home will have the option to check out computers from the office. Students will use the CodeHS IDE to write and run code. Other activities include designing websites and other digital artifacts. Through this process students will have opportunities to engage and collaborate to complete the assigned projects. 

Each unit will include video lessons, short quizzes to test understanding, sample programs to explore and modify, programming assignments. Units will also offer opportunities for collaborative projects to engage students in pair-programming. End of unit assessments will be used to gauge student learning. Towards the last quarter of the course, students will have  a creative project that will center on creating programming solutions to a real-world situation/problem.


### Impacts

Helendale School District’s Learning Continuity and Attendance Plan (LCAP) describes how the District concentrated and dedicated its efforts to support the needs of students through Distance Learning by making sure every student had access to technology to support their education. During the 2020-21 school year, the District made sure to have in place the proper technology to successfully implement Distance Learning synchronously or asynchronously. This school year, the additional technology purchased continues to support this need. The continuing pandemic has led to unprecedented absenteeism due to either infection or mandatory quarantine, therefore, concurrent instruction to students in-person, as well as those via Zoom, is necessary. Much to the chagrin of the teachers regarding this challenging feat, all classrooms are set up such that we are able to teach to these two populations of students. 

As much as our school is called the Academy of Careers and Exploration, we have yet to offer classes in computer science.  Having a class such as AP Computer Science Principles is a huge opportunity for the students in our school. There is a growing interest in computer programming at our school. The enrollment in the Introduction to Robotics course is increasing and holding steady. When the course was introduced to the school in 2017, at the start of the year 21 students were placed in the class but only 9 remained for the year. In the succeeding year, the number of enrolled students has increased, including increased enrollment of female students in the class. Informal surveys show that students enjoyed learning how to code for the Arduino microcontroller. In the STEAM class, one of the units students enjoyed the most was the coding unit where students had the opportunity to design their own app.
